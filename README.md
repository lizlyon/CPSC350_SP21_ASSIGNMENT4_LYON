# CPSC350_SP21_ASSIGNMENT4_LYON
## Program
* This assignment was designed to build a postfix calculator and DNA sequence program using GenStack. 
* The postfix calculator prompts the user for input. Once the compiler reads an operator, the total is pushed to the stack and outputted to console.
* The DNA program reads in a file, computes the complement, reverses DNA sequence, and writes to a file "dnaoutput.txt".
